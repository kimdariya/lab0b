It feels a little medieval if you ask me
Like I'm watchin' a sequel I've already seen
I could tell you what happens to the new king
When he goes out of fashion

I want my money back now-ow
I've been in the wrong crowd-owd
I'd never say it out loud-oud
But I've hated every word that comes out of your mouth
What should we fight about this time?
What will you write about this time?
What does it matter if you're not fine?
You should've kept that shit offline

It feels a little medieval if you ask me
Like I'm watchin' a sequel I've already seen
I could tell you what happens to the new king
When he goes out of fashion
It feels a little medieval kissin' the ring
In a gothic cathedral, have you ever seen
What really happens to people like me
When we go out of fashion?

They're gonna tear you from your pedestal, it's almost inevitable
I'm not bein' cynical, it's so unoriginal
If you get political
They'll make you a criminal
It's all a bit biblical
Don't put your camera down
You don't go to Heaven in a crown
It's not worth the money bringin' me back from the dead
I never said it would be any fun
You never should've trusted anyone
They'll love you 'til they know you're done
And then it's off with his head

It feels a little medieval if you ask me
Like I'm watchin' a sequel I've already seen
I could tell you what happens to the new king
When he goes out of fashion
It feels a little medieval kissin' the ring
In a gothic cathedral, have you ever seen
What really happens to people like me
When we go out of fashion?
